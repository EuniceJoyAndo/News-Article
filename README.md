Next, You will now be able to see the web page which looks similar to the given layout. so, when you click on the Read Full button it should display the details of the articles including the title, author, date and the full contents of the paragraph. In addition, you can also see check the checkbox but that is it.

For the Description, I am able to mimic the layout that is given and was also able to create the web page, although there some thimgs that still needs fixing and improvements

For the Requirements, I was only able to do half of the task in item number 2, which are A and B only, I was not able to do the remaining half of number 2 as I was not that gord at using the ReactJs Framework so I find it quite difficult to learn in a few hours. I still did my best in answering this exam. As I am still lacking in skills, I hope to learn more from your company.

Thank You. Have a great day ahead!
